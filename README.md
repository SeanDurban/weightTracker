# My Smart Weight Tracker
My Smart Weight Tracker application source code developed in December and January 2016.
It is currently published on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.seandurban.apps.simpleweighttracker)

# Motivation
I developed this application as I struggled to find a simple, lightweight solution to tracking my weight offline. Most applications used online databases or they did not show the data in a clear way, so I decided to create my own solution.I also wished to gain experience with developing applications and using databases as this would be my first experience with application development.
